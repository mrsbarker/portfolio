Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCU) will forever hold a special place in my heart for a number of reasons however this project will focus on the softball. I was fortune enough to not only attend Howard University, a well-known private univesity in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), but to also play D-1 softball there. It was a great experience and I recently stumbled upon the data reaching back to the years of my time there so I had to extract it for analysis.

### Purpose
Display familiarity with ELT/ETL method and various data analysis skills with interesting engineering-related data that spanned a number of years and existed on multiple webpages.

### Technology
Python is the language used in this project's associated files. Data was extracted from the meac softball website using Python web-scraping libraries: Requests and BeautifulSoup4. In addition to the expected data cleaning, special consideration had to be made as the earlier season webpages are composed of html text with the later season's utilizing html tables. After cleaning the data, organized tables were exported to comma-separated-value files for further analysis.

Feel free to view my [code](meac-sb-create-csv.py) to see how I extracted and transformed the data to suit this project.

### Results
The main product of this code is a group of csv files containing the softball statistics spanning a little over a decade.
