Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCU) will forever hold a special place in my heart for a number of reasons however this project will focus on the softball. I was fortune enough to not only attend Howard University, a well-known private univesity in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), but to also play D-1 softball there. It was a great experience and I recently stumbled upon the data reaching back to the years of my time there so I had to extract it for analysis.
