With a background in mechanical engineering, its no wonder I am entertained and intrigued by Battlebots! Teams of engineers and designers build robots with the express purpose of surviving ~2 minute matches. A robot can win via knockout or judge decision based on points earned in the match. 
### Purpose
### Results
The main product of this code is a csv compilation of all the 2019-2022 team/robot information and match statistics. In addition to these csv files, the analysis file produces the seaborn/matplotlib charts below
### Technology
Python is the language used in this project's associated files. Data was extracted from the battlebots website using Python web-scraping libraries: Requests and BeautifulSoup4. 
For more details feel free to view my [code](bb-create-csv.py) to see how I extracted and transformed the data to suit this project.
