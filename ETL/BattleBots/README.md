With a background in mechanical engineering, its no wonder I am entertained and intrigued by Battlebots! Teams of engineers and designers build robots with the express purpose of surviving ~2 minute matches. A robot can win via knockout or judge decision based on points earned in the match. 
Feel free to view my [code](bb-create-csv.py) to see how I extracted and transformed the data to suit this project.
